# Mobile-based-advisory-for-identification-and-management-of-insect-pest-in-agricultural-crops
Insect Pest take a heavy toll on agricultural crops causing severe loss to the farming community. Crop protection is one of the major components of crop management process. Crops are damaged by attack of disease, insect, nematodes and weeds. Managing them in the field and saving the crop from their attack is a major challenge for the farming community. Our crops are under threat from the day they are seeded til they are harvested causing significant damage to the crop affecting adversely to the farmer&amp;#39;s economy. Many factors influence disease development and growth of insect that includes genetics of variety, plant growth stage, weather, soil etc. Most of these information on insects, disease etc has been identified and documented by the Scientists and available in various literatures. This documentation will have a better significance if they are reached out to the farming community whenever they need it. Developing a web or mobile app having a complete knowledge base of insect pest carrying its detail in the background will be of great help. It will help in identifying the insect pest in the farmers field based on the damaged symptom or  3  by the image of the insects. On identifying the insect pest the system may provide the management.
Scope and Objectives:

A large volume of agricultural crops pathological information is available on the internet and various other resources, but it is not accessible to the farmers on demand. Hence to provide instant diagnosis of the infected crops and necessary advisory information to the
farmers an application is designed. The app focuses on the detection of pests and diseases in the crop and delivers the right information immediately to the farmers. It also delivers the information about the ratio of the chemical substance to be used to control the disease. The app is light weight and works offline. A database of about 600 diseases and their chemical and biological control is available. The application provides solutions to 51 varieties of plants. 
The main objectives of the proposed system are as follows: 

To detect the diseases at an early stage. 

The farmer can identify the disease at an early stage by placing the image of the infected area of the crop. Farmer can also place a query to know about the disease and the respective measures. Therefore, farmers can apply the required fertilizer in the required amount so that the crop can yield good result.

To detect microorganism and the bacterial based diseases.

Plant disease library is loaded with different fungal, bacterial and microorganism-based diseases. The farmer can be able to detect the microorganism or bacteria that has caused the disease. It also suggests the respective measure for the disease treatment.

To detect the deficiency of chemicals in the leaf.

Disease in the leaf can be caused due to the deficiency of chemicals in the soil and other factors. The application will help the farmer to identify the deficient chemical by using image search as well as text-based search and respective measures will be displayed.

To detect and recognize the pests.

Plant disease library is loaded with different diseases that are caused due to the insects and pests. The application will enable farmer can identify, which type of diseases are affected to leaf by using image search as well as text-based search.

To suggest the farmers with the suitable solutions and suggestions based on the detection and
predictions made.

Plant Disease library is loaded with different diseases and their management is available in the form of biological control, chemical control and traditional control format. So that farmer can use the effective methods for disease treatment.

Mobile App Available in 10 Regional Languages and works offline

The application displays the measures and management in 10 Regional Languages (English, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, Urdu, Marathi, Nepali). Hence the farmers can easily understand the solutions and can treat the plants.

1.4 Applications and Limitations:

The following are the application of the proposed system:

1. The application is used to detect the diseases in the leaf that are caused due to pests,
microorganisms, Bacteria and Chemical deficiency.
2. Management/control of the disease is available in the native language.
3. Ratio of pesticide/fungicide to be used is specified.
4. Biological and chemical control methods are predicted.
5. Application available in offline.

7.1 Experimental Results
Selecting a language for displaying the results:
The application displays the measures in 10 native languages which makes the user to
understand the measures in an easy and effective manner. While opening the app, first the
user has to select the language in which he wanted to view the measures.
